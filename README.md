# Second-Hand Car Price Prediction

A machine learning–based web application that predicts fair and accurate prices for used cars using key vehicle attributes. The application is built with Streamlit and deployed on Hugging Face Spaces to provide real-time price estimation for buyers and sellers.

## 📌 Project Overview
The used car market lacks a standardized pricing mechanism, often leading to overpricing or undervaluation. This project addresses the problem by leveraging machine learning regression models to estimate the market value of second-hand cars based on historical data and important features such as car age, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and ownership details.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- Interactive Streamlit-based user interface  
- Real-time price prediction  
- Machine learning regression model for accurate estimation  
- Deployed and accessible via Hugging Face Spaces  
- Lightweight, fast, and user-friendly design  

## 🧠 How the System Works
Users enter car details through the web interface. The input data is preprocessed to match the model’s expected format. The trained machine learning model then predicts the estimated selling price, which is displayed instantly on the screen.

📊 Model Description

The model is trained using supervised learning regression techniques on historical used-car data. Feature engineering and preprocessing steps are applied to improve prediction accuracy. Performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R² score.
